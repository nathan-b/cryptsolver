# cryptsolver

Curses-based command line cryptogram solver.

Give it a text file with the cryptogram, and it provides an interactive environment to help you solve the cryptogram. You can navigate using the keyboard or, if your terminal supports it, the mouse. 

Has a couple of nice advanced features, like a letter frequency table and the ability to solve Caesar ciphers.
